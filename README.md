🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction
A machine learning project using the Boston Housing dataset to predict median house prices. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation using various regression algorithms.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Boston Housing Dataset
Description: The dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service about housing in the Boston area. It includes 13 features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and distance to employment centers, along with the target variable — median home value (MEDV).

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python

Libraries:
pandas, numpy – data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization
scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

🚀 What This Project Does
1. Loads and cleans the dataset
2. Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Visualizes distributions, correlations, and outliers
4. Builds regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest
5. Evaluates models using RMSE and R² score
6. Uses feature importance from Random Forest to identify key predictors

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Key plots included:
1. Histograms of all features
2. Boxplots to identify outliers
3. Heatmap of feature correlations
4. Jointplots and scatter plots of key relationships

🤖 Models Used
1. Model	Description
2. Linear Regression	Baseline regression model
3. Ridge & Lasso	Regularized linear models
4. Random Forest	Ensemble tree-based regression
